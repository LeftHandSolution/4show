# Coding exercises

Here I store my various solutions for coding exercises for platforms like leetcode.

This is part of my learning experience of new languages or something what I have forgotten.

Solutions focus to be as fast as possible, but they also consider what the exercise is about: if it's expected to use a HashMap instead of array -> I do it even though sometimes there is a sacrifice to performance.

I don't provide full exercise descriptions, but wherever possible links are added in README files with Time and Space complexities.
